# Navcoin Technical Documentation

This repository hosts the assets used to generate the documentation at https://docs.navcoin.org.

Commits to the `main` branch are automatically built and deployed.

Documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

[reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) is the default plaintext markup language used by Sphinx.

Sphinx (*.rst) files are located in the `sources/docs` folder. **Do not edit files outside this folder!**

New sections can be added in the `sources/docs/index.rst` file.
