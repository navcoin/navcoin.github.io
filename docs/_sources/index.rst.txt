About NavCoin
-------------

NavCoin is an open-sourced digital currency with privacy-enhanced features. Transactions that occur on the blockchain of NavCoin are made in a peer-to-peer fashion with no need for intermediaries. With NavCoin, one can choose to store and transact coins publicly (NAV) and privately (xNAV). If one chooses to transact privately, it will not be possible to link a transaction to its sender or receiver, or even view the amount that was sent. This has been made possible by NavCoin's self-developed privacy protocol called Boneh-Lynn-Shacham Confidential Transactions (blsCT).

NavCoin was invented in 2014 and had no pre-mine or ICO. With block times of 30 seconds, one can stake their coins to earn rewards through Proof of Stake Version 3 (PoSv3) for helping to secure the network. NavCoin's current supply is 66,768,000 NAV with a block reward of 2.5 NAV, hence a decreasing inflation model. From the 2,5 NAV, 2 NAV are redirected to the staker who found the block, and 0,5 NAV are accumulated in a decentralized treasury used to fund community initiatives based on the outcome of DAO votings. NavCoinâ€™s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) enables the community to be self-funded its treasury, self-guided through consultations, and self-governed through consensus changes. Anyone who holds coins on the public side (NAV) can participate in the DAO by staking their coins. Each stake is the equivalent of one vote, and there is no minimum amount required to take part.

NavCoin Core is forked from bitcoin core v13.0, and as such, it inherits its P2P protocol and most of the RPC commands. This documment will reflect the new methods and implementations.

The official repository hosting the soruce code is located on `GitHub <http://github.com/navcoin/navcoin-core>`_.
